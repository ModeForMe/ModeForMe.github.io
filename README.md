# Mode For Me

Mode For Me is a kickstarter for emerging designers: winner of Startup Weekend London 2015. The live site can be found at [modeforme.com](modeforme.com).

## What is this built in?

The original version of the project, built over one weekend, was written in HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript and jQuery, and deployed via GitHub pages.

We are in the process of migrating the hard-coded data from our HTML files to a MySQL database for dynamic page-rendering. We've written a backend in Node.js, and hosted the project on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Unit tests have been written in Tape.

The "in-progress" build of the project can be found in the `db` branch.
